Two new tutorials are available. The [first]({{< ref "tutorials/tuto-01.md" >}})
we will create simulation of two models: an event generator and a event counter
from scratch. The [second]({{< ref "tutorials/tuto-02.md" >}}) we create a
Lotka-Volterra system solved with Euler. We observe results and dynamically
changes the input with RVLE.
