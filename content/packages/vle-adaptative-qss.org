#+DESCIPTION: Build ODE system without C++ coding

The *vle.adaptative-qss* package is a system package. It is available with [[../../documentationV][VLE]] without installation of any package. The goal of this package is to build ordinary differential equation system without C++ coding.

* Generic models

These packages provides generic models. You can use it directly without changing their source code.

| Dynamics             | Descriptions                                                                               |
|----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AdaptativeQuantifier | The quantifier of the variable.                                                            |
| Integrator           | The integrator of the variable.                                                            |
| Adder                | Each value receives on input port is added to each other and send to the output port.      |
| Generator            | Value read from experimental condition are send to the output port.                        |
| Mult                 | Each value receives on input port is multiplied to each other and send to the output port. |
| Constant             | Send a constant value on its output ports.                                                 |

* Plot models

This package shows at run-time of the simulation the output of atomic models into a [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][GNUPlot]] window or windows if several atomic models are used. Each input port is associated to a column data with the input port name as label. The dynamic have two optional parameters:
  - *gnuplot-duration* (double) :: Duration in second between two redraw of the [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][GNUPlot]] window. The default value is 0.3s.
  - *gnuplot-command* (string) :: The command to access the [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][GNUPlot]] executable. Default the ~gnuplot~ (or ~gnuplot.exe~) command is search in ~PATH~ environment variable.

* Examples

This example of a simple [[https://github.com/vle-forge/packages/tree/master/vle.adaptative-qss.examples][lotka volterra system]] is available as source code in the [[https://github.com/vle-forge/packages][packages repository]]. To get it, use the following commands:
