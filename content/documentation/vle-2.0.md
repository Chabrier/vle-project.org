VLE2 provides a new simulation which improves performance and functionalities.
VLE2 uses the new kernel called [Echll](https://github.com/vle-forge/Echll) a
C++14 tiny library to quicky develop DEVS, DTSS, DSDE and multicomponent
simulators.

## Quick start

With Echll, you can develop atomic and coupled model behaviour. For example, the
classical [counter-generators]({{< ref "documentation/vle-2.0/counter.md" >}}) model.
