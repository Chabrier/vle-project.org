To get access to this application :

On Linux/Unix, simply type the command `vle --help` in a terminal. The
CLI vle has to be into the `PATH`. On Windows, open a command
interpreter (application `cmd`) and type the absolute path to the vle
binary location e.g. : `c:\vle-1.1\bin\vle --help`. By default vle is
not set into the path, otherwise the command `vle --help` should work.
