In VLE, we have implemented the [DSDE abstract
simulator](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=293257) developed by [Fernando
J. Barros](http://eden.dei.uc.pt/~barros/) which enables parallelization of
atomic models and dynamic structure changes during simulation. We also
introduced an observation framework in the DEVS kernel simulator of VLE.
