### The Virtual Laboratory Environment

[VLE][VLE] is a multi-modeling and simulation platform. It is a powerful modeler
and a simulator supporting the use of different formalisms for the specification
of models and implementing the corresponding solvers in a unified manner.

In addition to the classical use of one single formalism for modeling and
simulation, [VLE][VLE] integrates, i.e. couples, heterogeneous formalisms in one
coherent simulation model. [VLE][VLE] supports the new generation of
inter-disciplinary simulation modelsâ€¦

[VLE] is mainly used by the [RECORD](http://www6.inra.fr/record/) platform. RECORD
is a platform of modeling and simulation of the agro-ecosystems. RECORD offers a
set of software tools based on top of the the [VLE][VLE] software suite. RECORD
provides also  *webrecord* (web interface for models) and a library models. It
is open to the community INRA and its partners. This project is supported by
[Environnement & Agronomie](http://www.ea.inra.fr/en) and [Applied Mathematics
and Informatics divisions](http://www.mia.inra.fr/en) of the
[INRA](http://www.inra.fr/en) (French National Institute for Agricultural
Research).
