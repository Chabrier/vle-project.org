### The Virtual Laboratory Environment

[VLE][VLE] is a multi-modeling and simulation platform. It is a powerful
modeler and a simulator supporting the use of different formalisms for the
specification of models and implementing the corresponding solvers in a unified
manner.

In addition to the classical use of one single formalism for modeling and
simulation, VLE integrates, i.e. couples, heterogeneous formalisms in one
coherent simulation model. [VLE] supports the new generation of inter-
disciplinary simulation modelsâ€¦
