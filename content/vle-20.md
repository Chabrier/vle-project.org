VLE2 provides a new simulation which improves performance and functionalities.
VLE2 uses the new kernel called [Echll](https://github.com/vle-forge/Echll) a
C++14 tiny library to quickly develop DEVS, DTSS, DSDE and multicomponent
simulators.

# Quick start

With Echll, you can develop atomic and coupled model behavior. For example, the
classical [counter-generators](counter) model.
