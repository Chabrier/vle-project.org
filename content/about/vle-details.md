The _Virtual Laboratory Environment_ is a multi-modeling and simulation
platform. It is a powerful modeler and simulator supporting the use of
different formalisms for models specification and simulation.

VLE is particularly well adapted for complex models where the coupling of
different formalisms is required. In addition to the classical use of one
single formalism for modeling and simulation, VLE can integrate, i.e. couple,
heterogeneous formalisms in one coherent simulation model.

For instance, VLE supports, and is not limited to, the modeling and
simulation of the following formalisms (stand alone or coupled together):

- Discrete Event Specifications
- Differential equations
- Difference equations
- Petri net
- Finite State Automata

VLE supports the following modeling and simulation paradigms:

- System Dynamics
- Multi-Agent Systems, Multi-Agent Simulation
- Decision support systems
- Learning systems

VLE is based on the theory of modeling and simulation initially developed by
B.P. Zeigler in the 70's and continuously enriched until now by an active
international community.

VLE is based on the [DEVS] formalism (_Discrete Event systems
Specification_). VLE provides a set of C++ libraries, the VFL (_VLE
Foundation Libraries_) and a lot of programs like a simulator, a graphical user
interface to model and develop models and tools to analyze and visualize
simulation outputs. The VFL are sufficiently well designed to allow the
development of new simulators, models or new programs for modeling and
analysis.

Our goal with VLE is to provide powerful tools for modeling, simulating and
analysing complex dynamics systems. We hope build an easy to use software. Our
development are complying with the [DEVS] specification [DEVS] and works made
by the simulation community. We are also pursuing the objective to develop and
maintain a community of users and developers using an open, agile and community
oriented development.

VLE is a free environment of multi-modelling and simulation developed under the
[licence GPL v3.0]. All source code are availabled on [Github].
