# IRC

The VLE project has an IRC channel available on the [Freenode
server](http://www.freenode.net freenode). This channel requires no password.
You can use any standard [IRC
client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client:
[Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/), [xchat](http://xchat.org/) (for Windows or
Linux), [Adium](http://adium.im/) (for Mac OS X) or
[irssi](http://www.irssi.org/ irssi).

The parameters to be configured are:

- Host: irc.freenode.net
- Port: 8001 (or 6667 If the first one does not work)
- Channel: #vle
- Encoding: UTF-8 (preferably)

# Mailing lists

Via the [Sourceforge](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/vle) web site, we have
created a set of _mailing lists_ for the discussions on VLE generally, its
evolution, bug reports, features requests, etc. in French or English.

- [vle-users](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vle-users): for any
  users.
- [vle-devel](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vle-devel): for
  developers of VLE and advanced users.
- [vle-news](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vle-news): only mails
  about new version of VLE.

Some remarks on the use of the VLE mailing lists:

- Before sending an e-mail on a bugs report, a features request, please verify
  that an answer does not exist in archives in the FAQ or on the rest of the web
  site.
- Attachments are limited to 40 KB. If you want to send more important
  attachments, place the file(s) on a server and send the URL to the list.
- Do not send e-mail in HTML format.
